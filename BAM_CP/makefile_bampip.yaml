# Default options.
# Can also be specific for a set of samples, libraries, and lanes,
# by including the "Options" hierarchy at the same level as those
# samples, libraries, or lanes below. This does not include
# "Features", which may only be specific globally.
Options:
  # Sequencing platform, see SAM/BAM reference for valid values
  Platform: Illumina
  # Quality offset for Phred scores, either 33 (Sanger/Illumina 1.8+)
  # or 64 (Illumina 1.3+ / 1.5+). For Bowtie2 it is also possible to
  # specify 'Solexa', to handle reads on the Solexa scale. This is
  # used during adapter-trimming and sequence alignment
  QualityOffset: 33
  # Split a lane into multiple entries, one for each (pair of) file(s)
  # found using the search-string specified for a given lane. Each
  # lane is named by adding a number to the end of the given barcode.
  SplitLanesByFilenames: no
  # Compression format for FASTQ reads; 'gz' for GZip, 'bz2' for BZip2
  CompressionFormat: bz2

     # Some BAM pipeline defaults differ from AR defaults;
     # To override, change these value(s):

      FilterUnmappedReads: yes
      # May be disabled ("no") for aDNA alignments with the 'aln' algorithm.

  # Mark / filter PCR duplicates. If set to 'filter', PCR duplicates are
  # removed from the output files; if set to 'mark', PCR duplicates are
  # flagged with bit 0x400, and not removed from the output files; if set to
  # 'no', the reads are assumed to not have been amplified. Collapsed reads
  # are filtered using the command 'paleomix rmdup_duplicates', while "normal"
  # reads are filtered using Picard MarkDuplicates.
  PCRDuplicates: filter

  # Command-line options for mapDamage; note that the long-form
  # options are expected; --length, not -l, etc. Uncomment the

    Coverage: yes
    # Generate histogram of number of sites with a given read-depth, from 0

# Map of prefixes by name, each having a Path key, which specifies the
# location of the BWA/Bowtie2 index, and optional label, and an option
# set of regions for which additional statistics are produced.
Prefixes:
  # Replace 'NAME_OF_PREFIX' with name of the prefix; this name
  # is used in summary statistics and as part of output filenames.
  NAME_OF_PREFIX:
    # Replace 'PATH_TO_PREFIX' with the path to .fasta file containing the
    # references against which reads are to be mapped. Using the same name
    # as filename is strongly recommended (e.g. /path/to/Human_g1k_v37.fasta
    # should be named 'Human_g1k_v37').
    Path: /path/to/ref/refgenome.fasta
