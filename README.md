## 1. Introduction
This repository contains a tutorial guide to basic population genetic analysis, using as input data illumina read sequencing derived from population level sampling. The tutorial is based upon the study of Pérez-Escobar et al., [(2021)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/10/4475/6311667), and will make use of read sequence data obtained from 32 date palm and their close wild living relativces (_Phoenix dactylifera, P. atlantica, P. canariensis_). It also includes data produced in intermediary steps to ensure that the tutorial can be executed completely.   

This tutorial is intended for users with a basic knowledge in programming and is designed to run in UNIX environments. The participant should ideally have experience using shell, and text file manipulation (e.g., using **awk, sed, grep, among others**). The workshop will be run on pre-configured laptops (Ubuntu 22.04). _A basic introduction to the UNIX enviroment with some useful commands is available [here](https://github.com/siriusb-nox/ONT-workshop-Oct-2023/blob/main/bash_tutorial.md)_. 

This tutorial requires the following programs/dependencies (it is highly recommended to have these installed before starting the tutorial). **Please make sure that the dependencies on which these programs run are also available**:
