## A. Genotype Likelihood estimation

Having the outputs from read mapping for every sample (\*.bam files) we can then proceed with the estimation of variants or genotype likelihoods (GLs). On population genetics, there are a number of differences when it comes to choose working with variants or GLs, summarised in the table as follows
