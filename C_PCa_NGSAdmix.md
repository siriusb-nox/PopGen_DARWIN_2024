## A. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of GLs
One important aspect in population genomics is the understanding of how multiple individuals from diverse ancestries are rleated to each other. One approximation to such understanding is by inferring how the genetic diversity of individuals is structured in populations. A popular approach to discern structure amongst populations is by using reduction dimension methods, such as Prncipal Component Analysis (PCA). Here, genetic variation is summarised through covariance matrices which are then depicted through coordinates in a dotplot graph. 

In this tutorial, we will conduct PCA analyses through the package `PCAngsd`, an associated software to `angsd`.

>[!CAUTION]
>**PCA analyses are not meant to be used as tools for clasification of individuals into discrete populations. They are rather a convenient mean to help understanding how much genetic variation there is between individuals and populations along axes.**


## B. Admixture/Structure analysis from GLs
Admixture analyses will be conducted on the package `NGSadmix`, an associated software to `angsd`.
