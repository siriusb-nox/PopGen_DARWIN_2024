## Read trimming, mapping, and realigning

Read filtering/trimming, mapping and realigning are essential steps towards the estimation of vartiants/Genotype Likelihoods. 
Read filtering and trimming do remove low quaility bases (as defined by a quality threshold set by the user) and sequencer adapters and barcodes that, should they remain on the read data, could bias subsequent scaffold assembly and mapping analyses.

Since we previously covered how to trim and quality-filter reads, we will focus on read mapping and realigning.
